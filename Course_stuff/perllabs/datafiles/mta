These are the times that try men's souls.
In the course of our nation's history,
the people of Boston have rallied bravely
whenever the rights of men have been threatened.
Today, a new crisis has arisen.
The Metropolitan Transit Authority, better known as the M. T. A.,
is attempting to levy a burdensome tax on the population in the
form of a subway fare increase. Citizens, hear me out!
This could happen to you!

Well, let me tell you of the story of a man named Charley
on a tragic and fateful day.
He put ten cents in his pocket,
kissed his wife and family,
went to ride on the M. T. A
 
(Chorus) Well, did he ever return?
No, he never returned and his fate is still unlearned.
He may ride forever 'neath the streets of Boston.
He's the man who never returned.

Charlie hande in his dime at the Kendall Square Station
and he changed for Jamaica Plains.  When he got there the conductor
told him, "One more nickel." Charlie couldn't get off of that train.

Now, all night long Charlie rides through the station, crying,
"What will become of me?!! How can I afford to see my sister
in Chelsea or my cousin in Roxsbury?"

Charlie's wife goes down to the Sculley Square Station
every day at quarter past two, and through the open window
she hands Charlie a sandwich as the train comes rumblin' through.

Now, you citizens of Boston, don't you think it's a scandal how
the people have to pay and pay? Fight the fare increase!
Vote for George O'Brien! Get poor Charlie off the M. T. A.
